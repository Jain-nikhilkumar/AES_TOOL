<h1 align="left">AES Encryption Algorithm üîê</h1>

###

<p align="left">The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data. It was established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001 and has since become the de facto standard for encryption worldwide.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Key Features üöÄ</h2>

###

<p align="left">Key Features üöÄ<br>1.Symmetric Encryption: AES uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, providing efficient and secure data protection.<br>2.Key Lengths: Supports key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits, allowing for varying levels of security.<br>Block Cipher: Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (128 bits), suitable for processing large amounts of data.<br>3.Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN): Employs a series of substitution and permutation operations for encryption, ensuring robust security.<br>4.Security: AES is highly secure and resistant to cryptanalysis, withstood extensive analysis by cryptographers.<br>5.Performance: Offers efficient encryption and decryption operations, making it suitable for real-time applications.<br>6.Standardization: Standardized by NIST, widely adopted in various industries and applications worldwide.</p>

<h2 align="left">Usage üõ†Ô∏è</h2>

###

<p align="left">To use AES encryption:<br><br>1.Choose an appropriate key length (128, 192, or 256 bits).<br>2.Implement AES encryption and decryption functions using a library or framework that supports AES.<br>3.Encrypt sensitive data using the AES encryption function and the chosen key.<br>4.Decrypt encrypted data using the AES decryption function and the same key.</p>
